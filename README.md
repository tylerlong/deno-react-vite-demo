# Deno React Vite Demo

## Instructions

```
deno install
deno task serve
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Known issues

It seems that in VS code editor, there is no type information for React, although I have installed `@types/react`.

When you install new dependencies, VS code often report weird compiling errors. Errors disappear if you close and re-open the file.
